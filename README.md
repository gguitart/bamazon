The intention of this program is to create a system that works some what similarly to Amazon.com. The purpose is to allow the user to input the ID of a product they'd like to buy and the amount they'd like to buy. Once completed, the program will check the database to see if there is enough of that product for the user to purchase, and if so will output the amount left as well as the cost for the user to buy that amount of a certain product. 

In this I used Javascript, MySQL, JSON, and node modules.
